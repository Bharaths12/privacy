  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This Chrome extension is designed to help users highlight and match keywords
    (such as GenAI sitelink headers and related terms) on web pages they visit.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    This extension does <strong>not collect, store, or share</strong> any personally
    identifiable information, financial information, or browsing history.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extension only processes the text content of the current web page locally
    on your device to perform highlighting and keyword matching. No data is sent
    to external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    - <strong>activeTab</strong>: Required to analyze the content of the currently
      open web page when the extension is active.<br>
    - <strong>scripting</strong>: Required to inject highlighting scripts into the
      page for keyword detection.<br>
    - <strong>storage</strong>: Required to save your custom keyword list and
      highlight preferences (such as colors).
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    This extension does not use, sell, or share data with third-party services.
    Synonym matching and fuzzy matching logic are handled locally or through
    free public APIs (if enabled by the user), without storing personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>Updates</h2>
  <p>
    The privacy policy may be updated in the future if the extensionâ€™s
    functionality changes. Any updates will be published on this page.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
